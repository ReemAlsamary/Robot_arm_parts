# Robot_arm_parts
 - This task is based on simulate the process of creating the robot arm, therefore I used 3D Builder app to connect the arm parts together.
 
 ## **Required Steps:**
 
 ## 1. Download The Arm Parts
- Download the arm parts from: (https://github.com/smart-methods/arduino_robot_arm), the required files under the psth (arduino_robot_arm/robot_arm_pkg/meshes/stl).

## 2. Upload the arm parts at 3D Modeling app
- I uploaded the parts at 3D Builder app is a free Windows app that lets you view, capture, personalize, repair, and print 3D models. Users either start from scratch by combining simple shapes, or download any kind of given 3D file from an online database. They can then edit these models using the 3D modeling space.

## 3. Connect the arm parts together
- Begin by placing the arm parts in the proper arrangement, beginning with the base and finishing with the gripper, as shown below:
1- Base
2- Waist
3- Arm 1
4- Arm 2
5- Gripper

## Final result
- Save the arm as an STL file.
- Finally the arm should be built correctly as follows:
